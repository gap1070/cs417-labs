        "1. The single line model had a lower average wait time. The difference was 2 minutes. This is a fairly large difference, since the single line literally cuts the average wait in half.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. I would have to say the single line is more fair. The single line has a lower standard deviation, and a lower max wait time, and the differences are not small. The multi-queue has double the wait, and 7 more minutes for the max wait time. This means that in the single line less customers get stuck in long waits, while the others move quickly. So its clearly more fair.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the multi-queue system, if there are couple of slow customers in a row you will get stuck while every moves fine. In the single line system you go to the next open register. This makes the single line system perfom better becaseu it prevents one line from overflowing, and it also balances the slow and fast customers. All these factors are why the single line average wait time and fairness are better than the multi-queues.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. I have seen the single line system in banks, the airport, and at the self checkout at target. I have seen the multi-queue system used more in grocery stores, and the other registers at target that aren't self checkout. I think the real reason every store doesn't use the single line model is because it takes up a lot more space. So if you are a store like a target or grocery store, which has alot of customers in it at once, there isn't really room for the single line model. You just need to put as many registers to help as many people as possible. So thats why I think that the bigger stores don't use the single line method, but the smaller stores do."
