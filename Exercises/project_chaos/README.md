# Project Chaos - Reorganization Exercise

This project is intentionally disorganized. All files are in the root directory without proper structure.

## Current State

- ❌ All source code in root
- ❌ Test files mixed with source code
- ❌ No package structure
- ❌ No proper separation of concerns

## Your Task

Reorganize this project into a professional Python src/ layout:


## Requirements

1. Create proper directory structure
2. Move files to appropriate locations
3. Fix all imports
4. Ensure tests run from root: `pytest`
5. Ensure main runs: `python -m project_chaos.main`

## Running Tests

After reorganization:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Running Application

After reorganization:
```bash
python -m src.project_chaos.main
```
